# whitelist_update

Just a quick tool I needed to update the whitelist.json file on my "offline" minecraft server.

Execute whitelist_update.py in the same directory as the .json file so the uuid fields should be replaced with the offline uuids of each player.

If you want to add a player to the whitelist, pass its pseudonyme as an argument, only its offline uuid will be fetched.
